Gboy's DBD Pak Installer (Note this is for epic games only. I will add an option for steam in the future)

Hi, I'm a noob programmer and this is my first program release please be gentle

_________
IMPORTANT

Make sure you have a Pak bypass program before you install mods otherwise it won't work.
You can download mods and pak bypass here https://www.nirvanacheats.com/ just go to 'products' for pak bypass and 'Mods' for mods.
**Also turn off you're antivirus if you want this to work as it's being flag as malicious but it's just false positives**

1. Download the program in the 'Releases'.
   
3. Put the program inside a folder then run
   
4. Select Paks folder - You need to select the Paks folder that is located in wherever you're epic games dead by daylight is located.
   Once you've selected the path of the 'Paks' folder the path will be saved in the .txt file so that you don't have to select the Paks folder everytime you want to install mods.
   
5. Select .pak/bak file - Select you're specific .pak/.bak file to install the mods you desire.

6. Execute - installs the mod you selected to the Paks folder
